          <p>
              The best applications, the ones we love to use, are not just bug-free.
              They are gorgeous! As developers, we have a responsibility to forge an
              experience that amazes people.

          <p>
              One major aspect of user experience is application performance.
              If an application works perfectly but is slow, users will reject
              the application. Therefore, its is important to maximize performance
              by being asynchronous and non-blocking.

          <p>
              As an application's user base and data grows, so does the need for it to
              scale. This, however, is not an easy task. It takes effort at all layers of
              the tech stack.  Every piece of the puzzle tweaked, tuned, and cached.

          <p>
              I am a big fan of clean code. I believe in things like DRY, reusable
              code. I love patterns like MVC that help us structure spaghetti into
              lasagna.
